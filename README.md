# 462StonoApp
This is an access management tool for the Stono River Preserve, built for the CS 462 Capstone class upon the request of Dr. Sebastian Van Delden. In short, it is a tool to help manage the usage of College of Charleston’s Stono River Preserve – about 1000 acres of land governed by a conservation easement - and improve security.
